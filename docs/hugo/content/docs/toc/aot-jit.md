# JIT
Cyber's just-in-time compiler is incomplete and unstable. To run your script with JIT enabled:
```bash
cyber -jit <script>
```

The JIT compiler is just as fast as the bytecode generation so when it's enabled, the entire script is compiled from the start.

# AOT
Work on the ahead-of-time compiler has not begun.
