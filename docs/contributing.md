## Using Cyber.
The best way to get started with Cyber is to try using it for scripting or for a project (at this time however, user modules aren't implemented so you're limited to a single script ðŸ˜…). This lets you get a taste of the language and in the process learn more about it. If you run into a bug or notice something that is inconsistent with the [docs](https://github.com/fubark/cyber/blob/master/docs/docs.md), please report an issue.

## Building Cyber.
The next step you might take is building Cyber on your own machine. In the process, you get to learn how to test and build the source which is useful if you want to make code contributions. See [Building](https://github.com/fubark/cyber/blob/master/docs/build.md).

## Language Design.
After v1.0 of Cyber, the language won't be changing much, at least that is the goal. So if you have a feature idea for the language or you don't like how something is designed, now would be a good time to propose it. You can use the [docs](https://github.com/fubark/cyber/blob/master/docs/docs.md) as a canonical reference to the current language features.

## Improving the VM.
Working on the compiler and interpreter can be tricky since any change can have a noticeable impact on performance and Cyber wants to be fast. For that reason, you'd need to have a better understanding of the internals. The initial version of Cyber was built with rather barbaric coding practices ðŸ˜…, but overtime it should be easier to understand and there will be better documentation.

Another useful thing to know is how to run the benchmarks. `hyperfine` is a nice tool for this and if you want to measure a specific part of your script you can use the `milliTime()` function in Cyber's `os` module.
